# Biwon Project

About Biwon (비원) 🍽️

Biwon is the name of our cafeteria, located on B1 (Basement Level 1). Our company operates multiple cafeterias, and users must select Biwon from the meal plan website to view its menu.

However, since I exclusively dine at Biwon, I only need to focus on this cafeteria’s menu.

Interestingly, the name Biwon sounds like “Be One”, symbolizing both the cafeteria’s name and the idea of unity in dining.
