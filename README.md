# Biwon Project

About Biwon (비원) 🍽️

Biwon is the name of our cafeteria, located on B1 (Basement Level 1). Our company operates multiple cafeterias, and users must select Biwon from the meal plan website to view its menu. However, since I exclusively dine at Biwon, I only need to focus on this cafeteria’s menu.

Interestingly, the name Biwon sounds like “Be One”, which not only represents the name of the cafeteria but also reflects my choice to focus on just one place for meals.

Beyond just a place to eat, Biwon is also a space for connection. Here, we can exchange thoughts about the food, engage in conversations, and build closer relationships over meals.
